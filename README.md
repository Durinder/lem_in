# lem_in

A 42 School project about guiding ants through a maze.

Input has the amount of ants, rooms and their coordinates, links between the rooms, and comments/commands.

For example:
![ant_farm](https://github.com/Durinder/lem_in/blob/main/ant_farm.png)

which corresponds to:
![map](https://github.com/Durinder/lem_in/blob/main/map.png)
